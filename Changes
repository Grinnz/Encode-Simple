  - Add encode_utf8/lax and decode_utf8/lax functions that will always use the
    correct UTF-8 encoding unlike the functions in Encode, and will use
    Unicode::UTF8 if installed. The new functions are now included in the
    appropriate :strict and :lax tags, and encode_utf8 and decode_utf8 are
    exported by default.

  - Fix Encode::Unicode test to not rely on how invalid characters are encoded,
    since this changed in Encode 2.99.

0.002     2018-02-22 21:09:15 EST
  - Promote utf8 warnings used by Encode::Unicode to exceptions in encode/decode,
    and suppress them in encode_lax/decode_lax. This brings the inconsistent API
    more in line with Encode::utf8, which does not use utf8 warnings.
